* Creating a TCE language translation
** Prerequisites
   1. determine the 2-letter language code for the language you are adding
      * https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry
   2. decide on the new url (=crimethinc.com/tce/foobar=)
      * we go with the name of the language *in that language*. For example, Spanish is =crimethinc.com/tce/espanol/=
   3. determine if the language is written left-to-right or right-to-left (=ltr= or =rtl=)
      * Wikipedia is a good way to figure this out
** getting up and running
   You can run the =to_change_everything= generator to get some of the basic wiring set up:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     rails g to_change_everything LANG_CODE URL
   #+END_SRC
   This generator will:
     1. create a language-specfic css file
     2. add url to =to_change_everything_controller=
     3. add a translation yaml
** slotting in the text
   1. obtain the pdf version of the language
   2. run this command in the terminal to extract the text:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        pdftotext the-pdf-file.pdf the-pdf-file.txt
      #+END_SRC
   3. using the pdf as a guide, put the corresponding text in the corresponding section of the new yaml file
      * wrap every paragraph in html =<p></p>= tags
      * include any internal html tags needed (e.g. =<em>=)
      * every line should be a single line (yes, some will be very long)
** prepare the images
   woof
** custommize the CSS
   Â¡GLHF!
** polish
   There are certain things that vary language-to-language. We will just try to work through them on the PR, but some examples are:
*** pdf has a custom font 
    You can usually determine what font the PDF is using via this terminal command:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      strings the-tce.pdf | grep FontName
    #+END_SRC
